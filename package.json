Jon has won a number of departmental awards for his contributions to the company and to his colleagues.",
      "Previously, Jon was in the UK Education Technology sector, primarily as a Full-Stack Developer working at prominent companies performing data interchange between schools and the digital tools they use. He developed integrations with several School Management Information Service Providers to create deep data-driven integrations aligning with vendors to standardized data sets. During this time, he also represented the UK on Access4Learningâ€™s Technical Working Group.",
      "In a past life, Jon was an academic and Senior Lecturer. He holds a PhD in formal software design (specifically the visualization and verification of class-based object-oriented software), an MSc (distinction) in distributed information management systems, and a BSc Hons (First class) in Computer Science, all from the University of Essex. To date, he has published in three high-quality journals, 10 international conferences, and contributed to a book. For five years Jon was a lecturer at the University of Brighton teaching various Computer Science subjects and was the course leader for BSc Hons Digital Games Production.
